Project Overview

A C# program to record the price of various materials, supplies, labor, and appliance costs for a home renovation project.  The program will record the price and source of the items.  Each item will have 3 to 7 options to choose from.  An example of this is listing 3 potential dishwashers for the home project along with the price.  The data in the program will be used to calculate an overall minimum amount, maximum amount, and average total cost to provide a range min-max range for a potential budget.  This data can be deleted and or updated as prices fluctuate, materials are no longer available, or overall design no longer fits with the specific material.
